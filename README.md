# Library Management System

### _What is a Library Management System?_

A Library Management System (**_LMS_**) is a
software that automates and replicates the
operations of an actual library. The software has
two sides: the librarian side, and the student side.
For the student, they can search for available
books in the library where they can prompt for a
request to borrow what they want. For the
librarian side, they are able to track the books
owned by the library. They can also see the
borrowed books and the student borrowing them.

### _Project Goals_

To develop a Library Management System with
automation capabilities where it is capable of
providing access to both admin and student side
in getting information on library materials: books,
reference authors, and book IDs. It should also
inform the student of the following: books
borrowed, borrowed date and a return ID. With
this features, it should lessen the burden for
students to send a borrow request by making it
possible digitally. The LMS should be able to
organize information properly with a visual
representation of data found on the library system.
It should have a model made with long-term
usage in mind to extend its software lifetime
while also not cluttering the library database.

### _Project Objectives_

The purpose of the project is to build a
software that can reduce the manual work for
managing book requests, records, book lists,
and track every request a student will make.
To achieve the said purpose using methods
that are time-efficient and cost-effective.
