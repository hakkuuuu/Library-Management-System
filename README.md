What is a Library Management System?
A Library Management System (LMS) is a software that automates and replicates the operations of an actual library. The software has two sides: the librarian side, and the student side. For the student, they can search for available books in the library where they can prompt for a request to borrow what they want. For the librarian side, they are able to track the books owned by the library. They can also see the borrowed books and the student borrowing them.
